# Boilerplate code for Vue 5 using Nuxt and Tailwind

## Stack

- Vue - progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. It's incrementally adoptable, meaning you can use as much or as little of it as you need.
- Nuxt.js - framework built on top of Vue.js that simplifies server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and routing for Vue applications.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) - utility-first CSS framework that provides a set of pre-designed, highly composable utility classes.

## Getting Started

```bash
# clone this repository

# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```

## Tips & Info

- Suggesting to use the Nuxt extension for VSCode which automatically starts the Nuxt web app locally. Very convenient.
